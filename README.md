Hi, Welcome to my tests for the following story:
"
As a Xero User,
In order to manage my business successfully, I want to be able to add an “ANZ (NZ)” bank account inside any Xero Organisation.
"

The code is written in Java and using gradle to get some libraries for selenium and junit. 

The following are needed to run:
1. JAVA JDK forlder
2. Gradle folder 
3. Chromedriver, located on folder ChromeDriver (on the same level as ManzXero repo)

To run the test:
1. Open the project in Intellij IDEA (can also be used in eclipse, but Idea is much preferred)
2. Build the gradle to get the external libraries (jar files) for the selenium
3. Run the test file using gradle/junit:
\ManzXero\src\test\java\SeleniumXeroTest.java
